# Introduction

In this project, I beef up the appearance and function of the card game.

# How to Play
Please refer to the demo video that includes 2 complete games played end to end (have two web browsers positioned side by side), demonstrating the all visual features.

In between the games, users could use the configuration dialog box to change the number of decks of cards and rank limit. 
In addition, you can always play a queen regardless of the last card played. In addition to providing flexibility to the player playing the queen, it also gives flexibility to the player that plays after the queen, because any card of theirs will also match the queen.
